 <h3>The Cutting Edge (1992)</h3>
 <p>Figure skater Kate Mosely seeks a strong partner for a difficult routine designed to win the next Olympics. Finding no suitable partner, ice skating player Doug Dorsey is the last hope. This introduces a romantic comedy interaction reminiscent of Aladdin's princess and diamond-in-the-rough character, except that the characters are at odds with each other. The interaction between the two carries the story of the show with a combination of humour, excitement and romance. Directed by Paul Michael Glaser</p>
 <h3>E.T. the Extra-Terrestial (1982)</h3>
 <p>An alien left behind on earth meets local kid, Elliot, and forms a special bond with each other. With the help of Elliot, E.T. is able to phone home so he can be picked up. However, the government is aware of the presence of the alien and has worked out that it is residing in Elliot's home. Will the government catch E.T. first before he gets picked up? The pursuit is the highlight of the movie. Steven Spielberg created an iconic movie in this story.</p>
 <h3>Kill Bill (2003)</h3>
 <p>An assassin is brutally backstabbed by her boss because her getting married would mean losing his top employee. However, the assassign survives. Code-name Black Mamba, the katana weilding assassin tracks all members of the group to find out where the master is. With Director Quentin Tarantino's gory blood trade mark, the action and the suspense makes for a very satisfying revenge movie. </p>
